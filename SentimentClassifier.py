# Finally, write code that opens the file project_twitter_data.csv which has the fake generated twitter data; 
# the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. 
# Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is.

# Now, you will write code to create a csv file called `resulting_data.csv`, 
# which contains the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score 
# (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), 
# Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), 
# and the Net Score (how positive or negative the text is overall) for each tweet. 
# The file should have those headers in that order. 

# Remember that there is another component to this project:
# You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets. 
# Check Coursera for that portion of the assignment, if youâ€™re accessing this textbook from Coursera.
